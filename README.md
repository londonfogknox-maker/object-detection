This repository holds python files useful for object detection projects. Currently, the model it uses for detections is the Yolov8 pretrained model for general item detection.

## Main file 

object_detection_utils file can 

(1) display an image with Yolo results with likelihoods and 

(2) save detections with likelihoods into a csv file. 

## Future Works

Improve baseline functions in object_detection_utils for better detection results.

Build more custom purpose files, like object tracking.

Add another file for video processing.
